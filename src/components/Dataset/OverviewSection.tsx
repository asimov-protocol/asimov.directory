        This dataset provides a structured representation of information related
        to Albert Einstein, his scientific contributions, and related concepts
        in physics.

        The dataset graph captures key aspects of Einstein&#39;s life and work,
        including: Biographical information: Birth date, death date, occupation.
        Key concepts: Theory of Relativity, Photoelectric Effect, Brownian
        Motion, E=mcÂ² (mass-energy equivalence). Awards: Nobel Prize in Physics
        (1921). Relationships: Connections between Einstein, the concepts he
        developed or explained, the field of physics, and his Nobel Prize.

        components: Nodes: Represent entities (people, concepts, awards) with
        properties like labels, types, and additional attributes. Edges:
        Represent relationships between nodes, indicating connections like
        "developed," "belongs to," "formulated," "explained," and "awarded."
